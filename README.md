# webmaniak-tools

A collection of tools I developed on my free time. Most of them might not qualify as 'best software of the century', however I thought it would be interesting to some people that I share the sources of them. Also, this collection may be synchronized with my website at [powerjpm.info/tools](https://powerjpm.info/tools).

Feel free to submit improvements via pull requests as you would do with any other GitHub project.
